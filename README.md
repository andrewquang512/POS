# Restaurant POS 2.0
This is the Restaurant POS 2.0 web application project as the assignment for students during Software Engineer course, given by Faculty of Computer Science and copyrighted by Ho Chi Minh University of Technology

# Introduction to project
Point of sale (POS) or point of purchase is the time and place where a retail transaction is completed.At the point of sale, the merchant calculates the amount owed by the customer, indicates that amount,may prepare an invoice for the customer, and indicates the options for the customer to make payment.In restaurant business, POS systems often include table reservation, ordering food, alerts, billing, creditcard processing and customer management. Even before the COVID-19 crisis, POS systems had gainedtraction across the industry. During the coronavirus pandemic, restaurants face greater peril than ever.Such systems are expected to increase business intelligence, reduce wasted effort and opportunity to scaleto a large business. Moreover, the systems should support take-away options Our customers have multiplerestaurants and have a need to develop a responsive web-based POS system that implement the currentbusiness flow as described below here (The current POS terminal can be replaced in this web-basedsolution)
